Hey! This is a toy project to learn more about interpreters/compilers and c++. I have always had an interest in "low" level concepts
and enjoy working on such projects in my free time. The goal of this project is of course to learn a lot, but also to move towards designing my own
TypeScript compiler. Inspiration came from [stc](https://github.com/dudykr/stc/tree/adc451c91ba1be8c90990686b1c830d5dd799bb9) and [TypeRunner](https://github.com/acyanes/TypeRunner)

## resources
[c++](https://www.learncpp.com/)\
[Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)\
and also lots of googling
